		<h4>Testing</h4>
		<p><code>mvn test</code></p>
		<p>Tests are implemented in <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/">JUnit</a> (v5.6.2). The testing is pretty thorough, so expect this to take a lot of memory and to run for several minutes. 
		Unit tests are implemented in the <a href="testapidocs/io/outofprintmagazine/nlp/pipeline/annotators/Annotator_Test.html">Annotator_Test</a> class. 
		Integration tests are implemented in the <a href="oopcorenlp/target/site/testapidocs/io/outofprintmagazine/nlp/AnalyzerIT_Test.html">AnalyzerIT_Test</a> class (and will run in both the test and verify goals).</p>
